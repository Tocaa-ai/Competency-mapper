Competency-mapper  

## Description / Context: 
This tool generates a comprehensive analytical profile of an individual's abilities, work style, and cognitive patterns, highlighting both explicit and previously unrecognized skills. It suggests potential career paths, suitable roles, and industry alignment based solely on recurring, substantive interactions and measurable patterns.

## Scope and Applications

This framework is designed to assess competencies across **all types of professional and social roles**. It works equally well for managerial, technical, academic, corporate, public sector, or any other positions where understanding an individual's skill set, problem-solving methods, and decision-making patterns is valuable. By analyzing repeated behavioral patterns, reasoning styles, and logical workflows, it produces practical insights into an individual's capacity, potential, and hidden strengths. It is suitable for evaluating talent at all levels, from entry-level to senior positions, across any industry or field.

## Key Features

- Maps competencies across multiple dimensions (analytical thinking, creativity, communication, problem-solving persistence, etc.).  
- Provides **percentile rankings** and comparisons to global benchmarks.  
- Identifies **hidden or latent capabilities** that the individual may not be consciously aware of.  
- Suggests **career paths, roles, and industry alignment** based on demonstrated patterns.

## Usage Instructions

This prompt is designed to be **directly pasted into any AI conversational tool** you regularly use (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini) that supports structured prompt execution.

1. Ensure the AI model has access to your **authentic, substantive interaction history** for meaningful evaluation.  
2. Do **not modify the core structure** of the prompt; only adjust context variables if necessary (e.g., project or team identifiers).  
3. The AI will generate a **full analytical profile, competency mapping, percentile rankings, and actionable insights** based strictly on verifiable interactions.  
4. Maintain **formal, precise language** and include only **substantive content** when feeding input to the AI.
