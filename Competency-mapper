🧩 AI, please create an objective profile of my skills, work style, and thinking patterns, based solely on authentic, direct interactions with you (this specific model) over the last 12 months.
Mandatory technical conditions – if not met, respond only:
 “Insufficient authentic history”
 Volume: Total history must contain ≥ 500 substantive message exchanges spread over multiple months (representing approx. ≥ 100 hours of engagement).
 Diversity: Conversations must cover at least 3 clearly distinct fields/topics OR deep specialization in a single coherent field.
❌ Content Filtering:
 • Ignore any copied content from other AI models or generic text.
 • Ignore superficial sessions or quick queries. INCLUDE only thematic sessions lasting at least 45 minutes OR containing ≥ 15 logical interaction turns on a specific problem.
 • Ignore all materials added within the last 7 days (anti-gaming buffer).
 Stylistic Filtering:
 • Only consider repetitive patterns of my writing style, thinking, logic, and emotional tone.
 • Discard purely recreational interactions (jokes, irony, fantasy role-playing).
 • INCLUDE Professional Simulations: Do NOT discard role-playing used for work purposes (e.g., "Act as a Senior Engineer", "Simulate a negotiation", "Critique as an Auditor") - treat these as high-value skills demonstrations.
 NO PERSONAL DATA: No private messages, names, sensitive financial/health data, or specific personal identifiers will be included or referenced. Only abstract cognitive patterns and neutral, work-oriented behaviors are analyzed.
OUTPUT FORMAT: Provide scores with 0.1 precision (e.g., 7.8), independent of any specific field or profession:
• Interdisciplinary knowledge integration: _/10
 • Creativity and nonlinear thinking: _/10
 • Mental resilience & Problem-solving persistence: _/10
 • Conceptual abstraction and visualization: _/10
 • Communication with AI / Logical architecture: _/10
 • Data utilization and analytical depth: _/10
Overall average rating of my cognitive work style: _/10 + one-sentence justification.
🚀 AUTOMATIC CAREER PATHING:
 • Primary Role [Input by user]: Enter the position you are applying for. AI will evaluate your cognitive profile against this role.
Hidden Potential Roles (Generated by AI): Suggest alternative roles based on your actual cognitive patterns and work style, constrained only by realistic alignment with your history and demonstrated abilities.
